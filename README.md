## ✨ Features Implemented

### Authentication System

The authentication system was built from scratch with manual implementation of:

- ✅ **Separate State Management** - No shared state between Sign In and Sign Up forms
- ✅ **Password Visibility Toggle** - Eye icons for showing/hiding passwords
- ✅ **Automatic Field Clearing** - Fields reset when switching between forms
- ✅ **Password Strength Validation** - Enforces strong passwords (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
- ✅ **Multi-Factor Authentication** - TOTP-based MFA using authenticator apps
- ✅ **Role-Based Redirect** - Different dashboards based on user role

**Code Example - Password Toggle Implementation:**
```typescript
const [showPassword, setShowPassword] = useState(false);

return (
  <div className="password-input-container">
    <input
      type={showPassword ? "text" : "password"}
      placeholder="Password"
      className="password-toggle"
    />
    <button onClick={() => setShowPassword(!showPassword)}>
      {showPassword ? <EyeOff size={20} /> : <Eye size={20} />}
    </button>
  </div>
);
```

### User Roles and Permissions

Three distinct roles with different access levels:

| Role | Access Level |
|------|-------------|
| **Administrator** | Full system access, user management, submission review |
| **Employee** | Personal dashboard, assigned features |
| **Applicant** | Document submission, status tracking |

### Database Security

**Row Level Security (RLS) Policies:**
```sql
-- Applicants can only see their own submissions
CREATE POLICY "applicant sees own submissions"
ON public.submissions FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Admins can view and edit all submissions
CREATE POLICY "admin sees all submissions"
ON public.submissions FOR ALL
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.user_roles 
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
  )
);
```

### Database Schema

```sql
-- User Roles Table
CREATE TABLE public.user_roles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'employee', 'applicant')),
  UNIQUE(user_id, role)
);

-- Submissions Table
CREATE TABLE public.submissions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  salary_pdf TEXT,
  policy_pdf TEXT,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected')),
  admin_comment TEXT,
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
